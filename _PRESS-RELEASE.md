There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Training Registration Approval Form

## Sub-Heading ##
  > A form to be used by employees to request training.  The form will collect the necessary data and send a DocuSign envelope once it has been reviewed.

## Summary ##
  > This form will provide automation through the use of DocuSign as an approval process to request and approve training requests.  Users will be presented with a form to complete.  Once users complete the form, a manager can review the information.  Once the review process has been completed, the manager can send the information to DocuSign for official approval and collect the necessary signatures to approve the training.

## Problem ##
  > Existing registration form is done on paper with manual routing and wet signatures.

## Solution ##
  > Removes the need for a paper registration form.  Approval signatures are routed via email, tracked, and stored in DocuSign.

## Quote from You ##
  > Simplify your process through the use of technology

## How to Get Started ##
  > Submit a form through the web application.  A manager can review your request to ensure the data is valid.  Once a manager marks your request reviewed, they will be able to click a button to start the DocuSign approval workflow.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "Great product and innovative idea.  No longer to I have to print/sign/scan/email my approval forms.  I can review and send all my approval requests from one dashboard."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > The form is available at LINK HERE.  Let's grow our professional talents and start requesting training!
